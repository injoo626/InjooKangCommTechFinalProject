    <p class = "title2"> Moment to Eternity </p>
    <p class = "content1"> Emotions are momentary. Whether it be a good one or a bad one, it fades away as time passes. <br> <br>
        What if we could store them eternally? What if we could revisit the happiest moments in our lives whenever we feel like we are deep down?  <br> <br>
        Revisit and relive happiest moments in your life with Momenternity. 
    </p>

    <p class = "title3"> How does it work? </p>
    <p class = "content2"> "Emotions are controlled by the levels of different chemicals in your brain, but there is no one "love" or "hate" chemical. 
        At any given moment, dozens of chemical messengers are active. ... <br> <br>By layering signals on other signals, your brain can adjust how you respond to things and can 
        effectively alter your mood." <br> <br> - Brain: The Inside Story, American Museum of Natural History  
    </p>

    <div class = "pngs2"> <img src = "../images/note2.png"></div>
    <p class = "title4"> Is it safe? </p>
    <p class = "content3"> Yes it is! <br><br> Momenternity has passed countless trials on both animals and human subjects. 
        The idea of injecting chemicals to provoke happiness might sound like a horrific distopian society, but 
        it is actually no different from intakes of caffeine, sugar, or nicotine. <br><br>Momenternity is even safer than
        those substances as we hire best chemists in the world to find the customized recipes of chemicals for each 
        customers.
